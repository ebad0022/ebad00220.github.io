                Hi there! My name is Ayah, I am 20 years old and currently enrolled in the Interactive Media Design program at Algonquin College. This is my 1<sup>st</sup> year in college and I'm already having a great time so far! I used to be a student at Carleton University and studied Criminology/Law for a semester and a half before realizing I had <em>no real passion</em> for legal work and wanted to do something more <em>creative</em> instead. I don't have a lot of prior experience in most of my classes like photography, digital graphics, and web design, however, I've always wanted to learn so I enjoy the challenge and feel proud of myself whenever I complete my work well. I'm also surprised at how easy it is to meet new people and make new friends, I am not really a social person so I'm glad I have people I can hang out with on campus. Another thing I never expected was being chosen as the class <abbr title="Representative">rep</abbr> for this semester, I just volunteered for the role last minute without thinking, but I'm glad I got chosen because I already see some things within our program that could be changed for the better and I'd love to be able to make a difference and make sure my group and I have a great 1<sup>st</sup> semester!

                Outside of my student life, I work at <abbr title="Britannia Woods Community House">BWCH</abbr> after class and help students from grades 1-6 with their homework. It's the <em>best</em> job I've gotten so far, and I love connecting and joking around with the kids. I think because I am a little bit younger than the average teacher, the students don't have a hard time opening up to me because the superiority gap is not that big, a lot of the younger girls see me as an older sister which is super cute; I try my best to be a good influence for them. It's funny because I am an older sister outside of work too. I think I'm good at my job because I've had a lot of practice taking care of little kids since I am the 2<sup>nd</sup> mom for my younger siblings. I have a younger brother and sister that are both in high school and a 4 year old baby brother. My house is <em>always</em> loud, my leftovers are <em>always</em> eaten, and my baby brother <em>always</em> runs into my room and goes through my things whenever I'm doing homework, but I wouldn't have it any other way. I am grateful to not only be able to study what I want to take/have a passion for, but also have my family and close friends support me along the way. I'm very proud of what I've been doing so far so I can't wait to see the results of my hard work.
