                        <dt> The Horizontal Rule (hr) Tag</dt>
                        <dd> This tag creates a horizontal line on a webpage to break up/separate the site into different sections. This tag is unique because you don't need to add a slash, you can just add another hr tag when you are done creating a different section on your page. </dd>
                    
                        <dt>The Paragraph (p) Tag</dt>
                        <dd> This tag allows the web designer to write an entry on their website, I personally like this tag because I feel like I can talk a lot so it's nice that I can write what I want without any set limitations.</dd>
                   
                        <dt> The Abbreviation (abbr) Tag</dt>
                        <dd>This tag can provide the full word/term when writing an abbreviation on a website. A box will appear when the mouse arrow hovers over an abbreviated word. I personally like this tag because I think it's fun to add an easter egg/surprise in a website while also being able to help people understand certain words that aren't written out fully. </dd>
                   
                        <dt>The Superscript text (sup) Tag</dt>
                        <dd>This tag is useful when talking about specific dates on a calendar or titles during a competition because when you need to write a number you can use the sup tag to add "st" "nd" or "rd" and have it half a character above the number.</dd>
                   
                        <dt>The Emphasis (em) Tag</dt>
                        <dd>This tag is used to add a "voice" in your writing, when you want to stress a specific word or sentence and add attention, you can add the (em) tag to italicize it and visually separate the selected word/words from the rest of the text. </dd>
